        <h1>Grilled Bacon</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Baking bacon at 350 degrees F is the way to get crisp bacon without<br>
            having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of<br>
            grease. It "fries" up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a <br>
            breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier.<br>
            Very nice when feeding a family or crowd.
